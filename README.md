# Biophotonic-tool-for-diagnosing-fungal-eye-infections-in-rural-India

In rural locations in India, there is a significant risk of developing fungal, and bacterial,
keratitis due to corneal injury from several factors, such as the use of bleaches and
fertilizers in agriculture and dirt scratching the eyes, making them susceptible to
infection. Due to the lack of resources and equipment, as well as skilled personnel in
the area, it is quite difficult to effectively diagnose a given eye infection as a fungal,
gram-positive bacterial or gram-negative bacterial infection. In 2017-2018, an
undergraduate group of biomedical engineers at the University of Sheffield produced a
prototype device that aimed to produce a cheap and accurate diagnosis by determining
the presence of fungi with the aid of a contact lens and calcofluor white. All code here was contructed for use with the device.
